        <p>
          New York cheesecake has a special place in the heart of the city.
          <br />
          Toweringly tall, dense and creamy, free from fruity toppings,
           it's the purest version of a baked cheesecake. <br>
          It's a simple recipe, though, made extra tangy with the addition of
          soured cream. <br />
          It is reliant on a heart-stopping amount of cream cheese, so make sure
          you get a good one (and not a light one).
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-size: 20px">Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
          150g/5½oz digestive biscuits <br />
          75g/2½oz butter, plus extra for greasing <br />
          900g/2lb full-fat cream cheese <br />
          200g/7oz caster sugar <br />
          200ml/7fl oz soured cream <br />
          3 tbsp plain flour <br />
          3 free-range eggs, plus 1 egg yolk, lightly beaten <br />
          2 tsp vanilla extract
        </p>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and line the base of a
            23cm/9in springform cake tin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the biscuits in a plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin to
            fine crumbs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt the butter and add the biscuit crumbs, stir to combine. Place
            in the base of the cake tin and spread in an even layer, then
            flatten (use your fingers or a the back of a spoon).
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove and leave to cool while you
            prepare the filling.
          </li>
          <li>Reduce the oven to 160C/315F/Gas 2.</li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese and sugar until
            smooth then add the sour cream and flour and beat again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually add the eggs and vanilla extract beating well between each
            addition. (Beat in the eggs rather than whisk as you don't want to
            incorporate too much air as this will affect the smooth surface of
            the cheesecake).
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the cream cheese mix on to the biscuit base then bake in the
            oven for 45 minutes. The cheesecake should be just set with a slight
            wobble and should still be cream on top with just a slight golden
            hint around the edges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the cheesecake is cooked, turn off the oven and prop open the
            door so that it is slightly ajar and leave the cheesecake to cool in
            the oven – this prevents the top from cracking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the oven is cool you can remove the cheesecake to cool
            completely before removing from the tin.
          </li>
        </ol>
